The symmetric difference of two sets is a set that contains the elements that are not shared
by the sets. In other words, it is the elements that are in one set but not in both. In Python,
you can call the symmetric_difference method to get the symmetric difference of two
sets. Here is the general format:
In this section, you will look at Program 9-3, which demonstrates various set operations.
The program creates two sets: one that holds the names of students on the baseball team,
and another that holds the names of students on the basketball team. The program then
performs the following operations:
• It finds the intersection of the sets to display the names of students who play both
sports.
• It finds the union of the sets to display the names of students who play either sport.
• It finds the difference of the baseball and basketball sets to display the names of students
 who play baseball but not basketball.
• It finds the difference of the basketball and baseball (basketball – baseball) sets to
display the names of students who play basketball but not baseball. It also finds the
difference of the baseball and basketball (baseball – basketball) sets to display the
names of students who play baseball but not basketball.
• It finds the symmetric difference of the basketball and baseball sets to display the
names of students who play one sport but not both.
