# Using Python Documentation for help, find and fix the errors \
# in the following Python code:

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'strawberry', 'grape', 'blueberry']

# Now, I wanted to add 'raspberry' to the list of fruits, but I forgot how to do it.

list.append(rasberry)


# I would go to the Python documentation to find out how to add an item to a list.

list.append('raspberry')
