# 1. Prompt the user for height:

height = input("Enter your height: ")


# 2. Prompt the user for favorite color:

color = input("Enter your favorite color: ")


# 3. Perform operations on variables a, b, and c:

a = 5
b = a + 2
a = b * 4
b = a / 3.14
a = b - 8


# 4. Determine the value stored in the "result" varibles after execution:

w = 5
x = 4
y = 8
z = 2

result = x + y  # 12
result = z * 2  # 2
result = y / x  # 2.0
result = y - z  # 6
result = w // z  # 2


# 5. Assign the sum of 10 and 14 to the variable "total"

total = 10 + 14


# 6. Subrtacts the variable "down_payment" from the variable "total" and assigns to the variable "due"

down_payment = input("Enter dollar amount: ")
total = input("Enter dollar amount")

due = down_payment - total


# 7. Multiplies the variable "subtotal" by 0.15 and assigns the result to the variable "total"

subtotal = input("Enter dollar amount")

total = subtotal * 0.15


# 8. What would the following display?

a = 5
b = 2
c = 3

result = a + b * c

print(result)


# 9. What would the following display?

num = 99
num = 5

print(num)


# 12. What will the following statement display?

print('George','John','Paul','Ringo', sep='@')

# Output: George@John@Paul@Ringo (the "sep" parameter specifies the seperation with @)
