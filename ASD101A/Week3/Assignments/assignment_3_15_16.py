# # 3.15 The following truth table shows various combinations of the values true and false connected by a logical operator.

# Complete the table by circling T or F to indicate whether the result of such a combination is true or false.

# Logical Expression    Result (circle T or F)
# True and False    T    F   = False
# True and True    T    F    = True
# False and True    T    F   = False
# False and False    T    F  = False
# True or False    T    F    = True

# 3.16 Assume the variables a = 2, b = 4, and c = 6.

# Circle T or F for each of the following conditions to indicate whether its value is true or false.

# a == 4 or b > 2    T    F       = True
# 6 <= c and a > 3    T    F      = False
# 1 != b and c != 3    T    F     = True
# a >= âˆ’1 or a <= b    T    F     = True
# not (a > 2)    T    F           = True
