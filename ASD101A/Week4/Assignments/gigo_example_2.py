# Create an example of GIGO with code
# GIGO = Garbage In, Garbage Out
# This is when your code is syntactically correct, but the output is not what you expect
# This is a common problem with loops
# The loop will run, but the output is not what you expect
# This is because the logic of the loop is not correct

months = int(input("How many months have you been at your job? "))
